# Survey-Form
 Streaming platform survey

## Backstory
Just a simple survey form. This project is a part of the freeCodeCamp's [Responsive Web Design certification](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/responsive-web-design/).


## Development
This project was made with:
- HTML
- CSS

Challenges:
- Development went pretty well.
- Learned that we can apply the pseudo-class **::focus** on inputs to help the user see what field they are currently filling.
- Learned that the CSS property **background** really gives flexibility in modifying background images.
